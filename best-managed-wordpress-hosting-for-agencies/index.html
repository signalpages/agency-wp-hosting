          <details class="faq">
            <summary>Is managed WordPress hosting worth it for agencies?</summary>
            <p>
              Once you're managing 10+ sites, switching to managed hosting reduces downtime risk and operational overhead.
              The cost is often less than the value of the time you stop wasting.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq">
            <summary>What's the single most important feature?</summary>
            <p>
              Isolation and rollback speed. Those two determine whether problems stay contained and whether emergencies stay small.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details class="faq">
            <summary>How should agencies think about pricing?</summary>
            <p>
              Don't chase “cheap.” Chase predictability. If your invoice swings month-to-month, your retainers and margins will too.

          When you manage 10+ client sites, hosting stops being infrastructure and starts
          being a business risk. This guide compares managed WordPress hosts built for
          agencies — not hobby sites.

      <!-- PROVIDERS -->
      <section id="kinsta">
        <h2>Kinsta for Agencies</h2>
        <p>
          Kinsta is the default choice for many agencies because it balances performance,
          isolation, and predictable pricing. It works especially well once you pass
          10–15 active client sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agencies like Kinsta for its support quality and staging workflows. The main
          downside is cost — but most agencies find the time saved offsets the price.
        </p>

      <section id="pressable">
        <h2>Pressable for Agencies</h2>
        <p>
          Pressable is a strong choice for agencies that want managed WordPress without
          complexity. It’s especially appealing if you prefer fewer configuration options.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may not scale as flexibly as Kinsta for very large portfolios, but for many
          agencies it’s more than enough.

      <section id="automattic">
        <h2>WordPress.com & Automattic</h2>
        <p>
          Automattic’s offerings make sense if you want tight integration with the broader
          WordPress ecosystem. This is a long-term stability play rather than a performance-first one.

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <section class="faq">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Is managed WordPress hosting worth it for agencies?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes — once you manage 10+ client sites, the time saved on maintenance, backups,
          and emergencies usually outweighs the higher monthly cost.
        </p>

        <h3>Why not VPS or shared hosting?</h3>
        <p>
          These options often shift operational risk onto the agency. Managed hosting
          trades cost for predictability.
        </p>

        <h3>How many sites before managed hosting makes sense?</h3>
        <p>
          Most agencies feel the break-even point around 8–12 active client sites.

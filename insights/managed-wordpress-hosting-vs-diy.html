        <h1>Managed WordPress Hosting vs DIY</h1>

        <p>
          Most “hosting” debates are really about something else: <strong>who owns the operational risk</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          DIY can be completely reasonable. Many sites run for years on a basic setup with minimal fuss.
          Managed WordPress hosting can also be completely reasonable, especially once you're responsible for
          reliability, uptime, and predictable recovery.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't a sales pitch. It's a calm comparison so you can choose a setup, standardize it, and move on.
        </p>

        <h2>What “DIY” usually means</h2>

        <p>
          DIY isn't one thing. In practice it's a range:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Shared hosting + a WordPress install</li>
          <li>VPS (DigitalOcean/Linode/etc.) + a panel (or no panel)</li>
          <li>Cloud VM + Nginx/Apache + database + backups + monitoring</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The common thread is: you (or your developer) are responsible for keeping the stack stable over time.
        </p>

        <h2>What “managed WordPress hosting” actually includes</h2>

        <p>
          Managed WordPress hosting isn't just faster servers. It usually bundles:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Managed updates</strong> (platform-level compatibility, guardrails, tooling)</li>
          <li><strong>Backups + restores</strong> that are designed to be used under pressure</li>
          <li><strong>Staging environments</strong> and workflows built for changes</li>
          <li><strong>Security posture</strong> (WAF, isolation, malware handling varies by provider)</li>
          <li><strong>Support that understands WordPress</strong> (not just “restart PHP” scripts)</li>
          <li><strong>Monitoring + incident response</strong> capabilities</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The real product is operational reliability, not a dashboard.
        </p>

        <h2>When DIY is totally fine</h2>

        <p>
          DIY is a good fit when most of these are true:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>You're running a small number of sites</li>
          <li>Downtime is annoying, but not business-critical</li>
          <li>Changes are rare</li>
          <li>You have someone who can actually troubleshoot (not just “install plugins”)</li>
          <li>You're comfortable owning the maintenance cycle</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If your site is basically a brochure and you're not shipping changes weekly, DIY can be pragmatic.
        </p>

        <h2>When DIY quietly becomes expensive</h2>

        <p>
          DIY gets costly when the “invisible work” becomes frequent. Typical triggers:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>More sites:</strong> every site adds updates, backups, edge cases, and failure surface area</li>
          <li><strong>More change:</strong> redesigns, new plugins, new landing pages, new integrations</li>
          <li><strong>Higher stakes:</strong> leads, ecommerce, memberships, paid traffic, brand reputation</li>
          <li><strong>Team scaling:</strong> multiple people need access, roles, and safe workflows</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The real cost isn't “the server.” It's the operational drag: diagnosing slowdowns, recovering from failed updates,
          and dealing with emergencies that always happen at the worst time.
        </p>

        <h2>What you're actually paying for with managed hosting</h2>

        <p>
          Managed hosting looks expensive compared to raw infrastructure because you're paying to remove
          failure modes that are hard to price until you've lived through them.
        </p>

        <p>
          You're paying for:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Time compression</strong> during incidents (faster detection, faster recovery)</li>
          <li><strong>Predictability</strong> (clear limits, clearer scaling paths)</li>
          <li><strong>Reduced fragility</strong> (isolation, consistent environments, tested workflows)</li>
          <li><strong>Fewer specialized dependencies</strong> (you don't need a part-time sysadmin)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If the question is “Why is this pricier than a VPS?” the answer is usually: it's not the CPU, it's the outcome.
        </p>

        <h2>Comparing the two: the honest tradeoffs</h2>

        <h3>DIY tends to win on</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Raw cost</strong> (especially at low scale)</li>
          <li><strong>Control</strong> (you choose the stack, the tuning, the tooling)</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> for unusual architectures</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Managed hosting tends to win on</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Operational reliability</strong> (less babysitting, fewer “mystery outages”)</li>
          <li><strong>Workflows</strong> (staging, backups, restores, access management)</li>
          <li><strong>Support competence</strong> for WordPress-specific failures</li>
          <li><strong>Consistency</strong> across a portfolio of sites</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The tradeoff is straightforward: DIY maximizes control and minimizes recurring cost; managed hosting
          minimizes operational risk and time spent firefighting.
        </p>

        <h2>A simple decision rule</h2>

        <p>
          If you want a clean rule that works in the real world:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>DIY</strong> is fine when the site is low-stakes, low-change, and someone reliable owns maintenance.</li>
          <li><strong>Managed hosting</strong> becomes attractive when downtime matters, changes are frequent, or you're responsible for multiple sites.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          “Best” depends on your model. The goal is to choose a setup you can standardize, keep stable, and stop thinking about.
        </p>

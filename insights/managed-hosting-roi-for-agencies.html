          If you’re still running client sites on cheap or unmanaged hosting, you may not be saving money. You may be leaking it.

        <p>
          Managing a growing agency often feels like playing a high-stakes game of Whack-A-Mole.
          Just as you land a big client, a server goes down. Just as you scale your team,
          your lead developer spends three days fixing a security patch instead of billing hours.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re still hosting client sites on cheap, unmanaged VPS setups or basic shared hosting,
          you aren't just “saving money.” You’re likely leaking profit through dozens of invisible cracks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is why switching to managed hosting isn’t just a tech upgrade.
          It’s a serious ROI lever for your agency’s bottom line.

      <!-- SECTION 1 -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>1. The Hidden Hourly Cost of DIY</h2>

        <p>
          The most dangerous lie in agency management is:
          “Our devs can handle the server stuff. It only takes a few minutes.”
        </p>

        <p>
          In reality, those “few minutes” add up to hours of unbillable time spent on:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Manual backups and updates</li>
          <li>Debugging server-side environment conflicts</li>
          <li>Hardening security after plugin vulnerabilities</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>The math:</strong> If your senior developer earns $80 per hour and spends
          just five hours a month on server maintenance, that’s $400 per month in lost labor.
          A premium managed host might cost $150 per month.
        </p>

        <p>
          You’ve already doubled your return before you even consider the billable
          work they could have been doing instead.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Speed as a Retention Strategy</h2>

        <p>
          In 2026, site speed is not optional. It directly affects search rankings
          and conversion rates.
        </p>

        <p>
          Managed hosts use specialized stacks such as object caching, CDN integration,
          and finely tuned server configurations that outperform generic hosting setups.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Better performance means:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Clients trust your technical expertise</li>
          <li>Fewer performance complaints</li>
          <li>Higher conversion rates for your clients</li>
          <li>Reduced churn</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If your hosting makes your client more money, they have no reason to leave your agency.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>3. The Sleep Soundly Factor (Risk Mitigation)</h2>

        <p>
          What is the cost of a single hacked client site?
        </p>

        <p>
          The direct cost is hours of manual cleanup.
          The indirect cost is damage to your agency’s reputation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Managed hosting providers typically include proactive security,
          malware scanning, and instant restore functionality.
          If a site goes down at 3:00 AM on a Sunday,
          it becomes their problem to fix, not yours.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reclaiming your weekends is an ROI that is difficult to quantify,
          but very easy to appreciate.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 4 -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>Moving From Cost Center to Profit Center</h2>

        <p>
          The smartest agencies do not absorb the cost of managed hosting.
          They white-label it.
        </p>

        <p>
          By bundling premium hosting into a “Maintenance and Performance” package,
          you can turn a $150 per month expense into a $500 per month recurring revenue stream.
        </p>

        <p>
          You provide the strategy and client relationship.
          The host provides the infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bottom line: managed hosting is not just an expense.
          It is an insurance policy against downtime and a productivity multiplier
          for your most expensive asset, your team.

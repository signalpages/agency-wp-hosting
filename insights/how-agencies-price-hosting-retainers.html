        <p>
          Stop reselling hosting at cost. Price the service: your time, your risk, and your expertise.
        </p>

        <h2 id="the-conversation">“The Conversation” (and why it’s your golden ticket)</h2>

        <p>
          If you’ve been running a web design agency for longer than six months, you’ve likely encountered
          <strong>The Conversation</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          You know the one. You’ve just delivered a beautiful, custom WordPress site. The client loves it.
          You’re feeling good. Then they ask the question:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“So, who handles the updates and making sure it stays online?”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          This is your golden ticket. Not just to steady monthly income, but to a healthier relationship with clients.
          Yet so many agencies stumble here, treating hosting like a pass-through cost rather than the valuable service it is.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let’s talk about how smart agencies price hosting retainers—and why you should never, ever resell hosting at cost.
        </p>

        <h2 id="reseller-vs-service-provider">The shift from “reseller” to service provider</h2>

        <p>
          First, clear the mindset hurdle: if you’re buying a $20/month server from a hosting company and charging the client $20,
          you aren’t an agency—you’re a middleman. And middlemen are easy to replace.
        </p>

        <p>
          The moment a client has downtime or a malware scare, they aren’t calling the hosting company—they’re calling you.
          You handle the stress, the late-night emergencies, and the “my site is broken” emails.
        </p>

        <h3>Your pricing needs to cover</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Cost of Goods:</strong> the actual server or hosting plan</li>
          <li><strong>Your Time:</strong> maintenance, updates, uptime monitoring</li>
          <li><strong>Your Risk:</strong> the liability you take on when you put your name on the line</li>
          <li><strong>Your Expertise:</strong> knowing how to fix it when things go wrong</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="three-tiers">The three tiers of hosting retainers</h2>

        <p>
          Most successful agencies land on a three-tier model. It lets clients choose their level of involvement (and budget)
          while ensuring you don’t lose money on high-maintenance accounts.
        </p>

        <h3>Tier 1: The “Essentials” Plan ($75–$150/month)</h3>

        <p>
          For the small business owner who wants “set it and forget it.” They don’t want to log in; they just want the site fast and safe.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Pricing rationale:</strong> Covers managed hosting cost (roughly $20–$30) plus ~1–2 hours of low-level maintenance per month.
        </p>

        <h4>What’s included</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Managed WordPress hosting (on a reliable platform like WP Engine, Kinsta, or a reseller account)</li>
          <li>Daily backups stored off-server</li>
          <li>Core WordPress, theme, and plugin updates</li>
          <li>Basic security monitoring</li>
          <li>1 hour of “small changes” per month (like a text tweak)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tier 2: The “Performance” Plan ($250–$500/month)</h3>

        <p>
          The sweet spot. These clients have e-commerce or lead-generation sites that matter. They care about speed and uptime.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Pricing rationale:</strong> More robust hosting (or VPS) plus time for performance reporting and proactive care.
        </p>

        <h4>What’s included</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Everything in Essentials</li>
          <li>Premium performance optimization (caching, image compression, database optimization)</li>
          <li>Uptime monitoring with SMS alerts</li>
          <li>Monthly performance reports (Core Web Vitals, traffic stats)</li>
          <li>3 hours of development time (for bigger content updates)</li>
          <li>Priority support (they skip the line)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tier 3: The “Growth” Partner ($750–$1,500+/month)</h3>

        <p>
          Reserved for agencies acting as a true fractional CTO or marketing partner. The retainer isn’t just about keeping the lights on;
          it’s about growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Pricing rationale:</strong> Beyond maintenance into strategy. You aren’t just updating plugins; you are ensuring the site converts.
        </p>

        <h4>What’s included</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Everything in Performance</li>
          <li>Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) suggestions</li>
          <li>SEO health checks and tweaks</li>
          <li>Advanced security scans and malware removal guarantees</li>
          <li>A dedicated account manager / primary point of contact</li>
          <li>Strategy calls to align the website with business goals</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="rule-of-three">The “Rule of Three” for calculating your costs</h2>

        <p>
          If you’re staring at a blank spreadsheet wondering how to pick numbers, use this simple formula.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Calculate your hard costs.</strong><br />
            Hosting plus paid plugins/tools (backups, security, etc.). Call that <strong>X</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Calculate your time.</strong><br />
            Estimate monthly hours (2? 5?). Multiply by your hourly rate (e.g., $100/hr). Call that <strong>Y</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add the risk multiplier.</strong><br />
            Add buffer for the “oh no” factor. Multiply <strong>(X + Y)</strong> by <strong>1.5</strong> or <strong>2</strong>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This ensures you aren’t just breaking even. You’re being paid for the peace of mind you provide.
        </p>

        <h2 id="mistakes">Common mistakes to avoid</h2>

        <h3>Nickel-and-diming</h3>
        <p>
          Don’t charge a client an extra $15 because they asked you to update a blog post. If you’re on a retainer, absorb the small stuff.
          It builds trust. Save the overage billing for major projects (like building a new landing page).
        </p>

        <h3>Using cheap hosting</h3>
        <p>
          If you’re putting clients on a $3.99 shared hosting plan to maximize profit margin, you’re building a house on a shaky foundation.
          You’ll spend all your time fighting slow speeds and outages. Use enterprise-grade partners so your life is easier.
        </p>

        <h3>One-year contracts</h3>
        <p>
          Try to bill retainers monthly but lock clients into a 12-month term. It stabilizes your cash flow and ensures you aren’t
          renegotiating pricing every 30 days.
        </p>

        <h2 id="bottom-line">The bottom line</h2>

        <p>
          Your hosting retainer isn’t just about server space. It’s a retainer for your sanity.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you price correctly, you filter out the clients who don’t value your work, and you attract the ones who understand
          that a website is a business asset that needs care.
        </p>

        <p>
          Charge what you’re worth. Sleep better at night. And let the hosting infrastructure do the heavy lifting while you cash the checks.
        </p>

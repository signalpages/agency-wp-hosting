        <h2>“The Conversation” (and why it's your golden ticket)</h2>
        <p>
          If you've been running a web design agency for longer than six months, you've likely encountered
          <strong>The Conversation</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know the one. You've just delivered a beautiful, custom WordPress site. The client loves it.
          You're feeling good. Then they ask the question:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“So, who handles the updates and making sure it stays online?”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          This is your golden ticket. Not just to steady monthly income, but to a healthier relationship with clients.
          Yet so many agencies stumble here, treating hosting like a pass-through cost rather than the valuable service it is.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's talk about how smart agencies price hosting retainers—and why you should never, ever resell hosting at cost.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="reseller-vs-service-provider">
        <h2>The shift from “reseller” to service provider</h2>
        <p>
          First, clear the mindset hurdle: if you're buying a $20/month server from a hosting company and charging the client $20,
          you aren't an agency—you're a middleman. And middlemen are easy to replace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment a client has downtime or a malware scare, they aren't calling the hosting company, they're calling <em>you</em>.
          You handle the stress, the late-night emergencies, and the “my site is broken” emails.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h3>Your pricing needs to cover</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The Cost of Goods:</strong> the actual server or hosting plan</li>
            <li><strong>Your Time:</strong> maintenance, updates, uptime monitoring</li>
            <li><strong>Your Risk:</strong> the liability you take on when you put your name on the line</li>
            <li><strong>Your Expertise:</strong> knowing how to fix it when things go wrong</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="three-tiers">
        <h2>The three tiers of hosting retainers</h2>
        <p>
          Most successful agencies land on a three-tier model. It lets clients choose their level of involvement (and budget)
          while ensuring you don't lose money on high-maintenance accounts.
        </p>

        <section class="tier" id="tier-1">
          <h3>Tier 1: The “Essentials” Plan ($75 - $150/month)</h3>
          <p>
            For the small business owner who wants “set it and forget it.” They don't want to log in; they just want the site fast and safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pricing rationale:</strong> Covers managed hosting cost (roughly $20-$30) plus ~1-2 hours of low-level maintenance per month.
          </p>
          <h4>What's included</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Managed WordPress hosting (on a reliable platform like WP Engine, Kinsta, or a reseller account)</li>
            <li>Daily backups stored off-server</li>
            <li>Core WordPress, theme, and plugin updates</li>
            <li>Basic security monitoring</li>
            <li>1 hour of “small changes” per month (like a text tweak)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="tier" id="tier-2">
          <h3>Tier 2: The “Performance” Plan ($250 - $500/month)</h3>
          <p>
            The sweet spot. These clients have e-commerce or lead-gen sites that matter. They care about speed and uptime.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pricing rationale:</strong> More robust hosting (or VPS) plus time for performance reporting and proactive care.
          </p>
          <h4>What's included</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Everything in Essentials</li>
            <li>Premium performance optimization (caching, image compression, database optimization)</li>
            <li>Uptime monitoring with SMS alerts</li>
            <li>Monthly performance reports (Core Web Vitals, traffic stats)</li>
            <li>3 hours of development time (for bigger content updates)</li>
            <li>Priority support (they skip the line)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="tier" id="tier-3">
          <h3>Tier 3: The “Growth” Partner ($750 - $1,500+/month)</h3>
          <p>
            Reserved for agencies acting as fractional CTO or marketing partner. It's not just keeping the lights on—it's about growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pricing rationale:</strong> Beyond maintenance into strategy. You're ensuring the site converts, not just updating plugins.
          </p>
          <h4>What's included</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Everything in Performance</li>
            <li>Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) suggestions</li>
            <li>SEO health checks and tweaks</li>
            <li>Advanced security scans and malware removal guarantees</li>
            <li>A dedicated account manager / primary point of contact</li>
            <li>Strategy calls to align the website with business goals</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section id="rule-of-three">
        <h2>The “Rule of Three” for calculating your costs</h2>
        <p>
          If you're staring at a blank spreadsheet wondering how to pick numbers, use this simple formula.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Calculate your hard costs.</strong><br />
            Hosting plus paid plugins/tools (backups, security, etc.). Call that <strong>X</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Calculate your time.</strong><br />
            Estimate monthly hours (2? 5?). Multiply by your hourly rate (e.g., $100/hr). Call that <strong>Y</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add the risk multiplier.</strong><br />
            Buffer for the “oh no” factor. Multiply <strong>(X + Y)</strong> by <strong>1.5</strong> or <strong>2</strong>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="callout">
          <h3>Why this works</h3>
          <p>
            You're not just breaking even—you're being paid for peace of mind, responsibility, and rapid response when things go sideways.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="mistakes">
        <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>

        <h3>1) Nickel-and-diming</h3>
        <p>
          Don't charge an extra $15 because they asked for a blog post update. If they're on retainer, absorb the small stuff.
          It builds trust. Save overage billing for real projects (like a new landing page).
        </p>

        <h3>2) Using cheap hosting</h3>
        <p>
          If you put clients on bargain shared hosting to maximize margin, you'll pay for it in outages and slow sites.
          Use dependable partners so your life is easier.
        </p>

        <h3>3) One-month “handshake” retainers</h3>
        <p>
          Bill monthly, but lock clients into a 12-month term when possible. It stabilizes cash flow and prevents constant renegotiation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="bottom-line">
        <h2>The bottom line</h2>
        <p>
          Your hosting retainer isn't just server space. It's a retainer for your sanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you price correctly, you filter out clients who don't value your work—and attract the ones who treat the website as a real business asset.
        </p>

        <div class="cta">
          <h3>Want help packaging your hosting retainers?</h3>
          <p>
            If you want a simple 1-page retainer menu (tiers, inclusions, terms, and “what counts as small changes”), build it once and reuse it for every client.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <details>
          <summary>Should I disclose my underlying hosting provider?</summary>
          <p>
            You can, but keep the contract anchored on <em>your</em> service outcomes: uptime monitoring, updates, backups, security, and response time.
            Clients buy peace of mind, not a line item.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What's a good default contract term?</summary>
          <p>
            Many agencies do monthly billing with a 12-month term. It's predictable for you, and it reduces churn from “price shopping.”
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How do I handle requests that exceed the retainer?</summary>
          <p>
            Define a clean boundary: small changes are included; new pages/features are scoped as a project.
            Keep it simple and consistent.

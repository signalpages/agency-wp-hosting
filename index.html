          <h2>FAQs</h2>
        </div>

        <details class="faq">
          <summary>Is managed WordPress hosting worth it for agencies?</summary>
          <p>
            Often, yes—once you’re managing 10+ client sites. The win is fewer fires: better support, reliable backups, staging workflows,
            and less time spent debugging hosting issues.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq">
          <summary>Should agencies use WordPress multisite?</summary>
          <p>
            Sometimes, but it adds operational complexity. Many agencies prefer isolated sites for client separation and easier migrations.
            If you do use multisite, pick a host that supports your workflow and scaling constraints.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq">
          <summary>How should agencies bill clients for hosting?</summary>
          <p>
            Most agencies either bundle hosting into retainers or pass through a predictable line item. Choose hosts with clear plan tiers
            and understandable scaling so you can price confidently.
          </p>
